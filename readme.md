You will have 2 minutes to mark as many points as you can, and if you reach 100 points you win!
Each time you hit the enemy, the enemy's life will decrease, and if it reaches 0, the enemy will be destroyed and you'll win some points. Additionally, if you hit the enemy that is glowing, you'll activate the superpower and you'll be able to shoot from the head and the tail.
All the spawns are random, so you'll never know where the enemy will appear, use your superpower wisely and try to get as many points as you can!
